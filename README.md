# Times Say
What does the Times say? This app retrieves movie reviews from the New York Times archives. The NYT Movie Reviews API is available here: https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/movie-reviews-api/1/overview

*TODO: Add live site URL.*

## Technologies Used
The goal is to create a **S**ingle **P**age **A**pplication (**SPA**) using the React library and other Javascript packages from the vast `npm` repository. The project will most likely be hosted on Heroku, or with Surge if it suits my needs better.

Once again project management is handled with [Trello](https://trello.com/b/TrNxWlVZ/times-say).
